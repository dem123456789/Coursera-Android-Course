# Coursera Android Course

Lab exercises and final mini project for [Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/androidpart1)

 
## Instruction

#### Lab Exercises

Each week's videos will be accompanied by a lab exercise consisting of an assignment write-up, partially completed source code, and executable test cases. The students will run the test cases on their own computers to determine whether they've successfully completed the lab. For some labs, we will also require students to examine and grade the submissions of other students.

Each lesson covers multiple Android source code examples. I strongly encourage students to download all the examples and to consult them both while watching the lecture and afterwards. The source code is publicly available on github:

#### Mini-Project

The course will also have a final mini-project, which asks learners to put together what theyâ€™ve learned into an application that is responsive and elegantly designed.
